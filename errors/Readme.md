Prisma 2 ecosystem provides various layers of tools that communicate with each other to provide desired outcome.

Broadly, the life-cycle of a request (Query request or CLI command) can be seen in this architecture diagram.

This document covers our error handling strategy and covers the following:

1. Known/unknown errors
2. Error log masking
3. Error character encoding

As the Prisma SDK acts as the interface between binaries and SDK clients. A lot of error handling is managed in SDK layer.

# Error Causes, Codes, and Handling Strategies

There can be various reasons for a request/operation to fail. This section broadly classifies potential error causes and handling strategies.

## Validation Errors

These are usually caused by faulty user input. For example,

- Incorrect database credentials
- Invalid data source URL
- Malformed schema syntax

Handling strategy: Any user input must be validated and user should be notified about the validation error details.

## Prisma Error (Bug is Prisma code)

These are caused due to a bug in a Prisma component. For example,

- Photon builds incorrect query for the query engine
- Lift generates incorrect migration steps

This occurrence of these should be rare.

Handling strategy: User should be notified about the Prisma bug and should be prompted to send the error report to Prisma team manually or via telemetry.

## OS Error

These are caused due to an OS system call failure. For example,

- SDK failed to bind a port for query engine

Handling strategy: Notify the user by relaying the message from OS and suggesting them to retry. They might need to free up resources or do something at the OS level.

In certain cases, like when a port collision, Prisma SDK can try to retry gracefully as well with a different port.

## Data Source Error

These are caused when a data source lacks availability, For example,

- Database is not reachable
- Database timeout

Handling strategy: Notify the user by relaying the error message from data source.

## Domain Error

These are usually caused when a database constraint fails. For example,

- Record not found
- Unique constraint violation
- Foreign key constraint violation
- Custom constraint violation

Handling strategy: Domain errors would usually originate from the data source and the underlying message should be relayed to the user with some context.

# Error Codes

Error codes made identification/classification of error easier. Moreover, for tools like Photon, they also make programmatically handling error conditions easier.

This section describes our error prefix and error numbering strategy.

## Prefix

Marking every known error with a structured error code prefix and a number would make error identification and parsing easier for the users. We can also recommend third party generators/tools to follow the same error code convention.

| Error Cause        | Prefix |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| Validation Error   | VE     |
| Prisma Error (Bug) | PE     |
| OS Error           | OSE    |
| Data source Error  | DSE    |
| Domain Error       | DE     |

## Error Code Numbers

// TODO: Dump thoughts about error code numbers

# Known Errors

Whenever we show an error, we should always show a path forward towards resolution. If we don't know the path forward, we should at least link to a place to get help.

## List of Known Errors

The following sections(s) contain lists of currently known errors per tool. We'll update this list as more error conditions are identified.

Note that some errors might bubble at a lower layer and be presented at an upper later for developer experience.

# Unknown Errors

As Prisma 2 is still early, we're not yet aware of all error cases that can occur. This section explains what should happen when Prisma encounters an _unknown_ error.

An error can occur in any of the following tools that currently make up Prisma 2's developer surface area:

- Photon.js
- Studio
- CLI

When an unknown error occurs, **our primary goal** is to get the user to report it by creating a new GitHub issue or send the error report to us via telemetry.

Error messages should include clear guidelines of where to report the issue and what information to include. The following sections provide the templates for these error message per tool.

## Unknown Error Template

Additionally to showing the the error message directly to the user by printing it to the console, we also want to provide rich error reports that users can use to report the issue manually via Github issue or automatically via telemetry. These error reports are stored as markdown files or zip files on the file system. Therefore, each tool has two templates:

- **Logging output** directly shown to the user
- **Error report** (markdown or a zip file) stored on the file system

The error report generally is more exhaustive than the logging output (e.g. it also contains the Prisma schema which would be overkill if printed to the terminal as well). It is also written in Markdown enabling the user to copy and paste the report as a GitHub issue directly.

## Unknown Error Handling

### Photon.js

On encountering an unexpected error, Photon should inform the user and prepare an error report with context of the issue and masked sensitive information to be shared manually or via telemetry.

Note that studio can also yield Photon errors as it uses Photon internally. The error log generation in that case would be done by Photon but the UI to prompt user to create a Github issue or send it to us would be handled by Studio.

// TODO: Replace this with actual Studio telemetry spec once that is available.

### CLI

On encountering an unexpected error, CLI should inform the user and prepare an error report with context of the issue and masked sensitive information to be shared manually or via telemetry.

This is covered in the [CLI telemetry spec](https://prisma-specs.netlify.com/cli/telemetry/).

// TODO: Replace this with actual CLI telemetry spec once that is available.

# Error Log Masking

Both logging output, error report might contain logs with sensitive information like database URL. Prisma 2 should mask the sensitive information (with asterisks `********`) before dumping the data on the file system.

The error report to be sent back automatically might also contain some proprietary information like the database schema via Prisma schema file.

We must ask the user before collecting such information. This is covered in the [telemetry spec](https://prisma-specs.netlify.com/cli/telemetry/).

// TODO: Replace this CLI telemetry spec link with general telemetry spec link once that is available.

# Error Character Encoding

// TODO: This probably belongs to Photon.js error handling spec but parts of it like making it parsable and error codes belong to this spec.

Photon generates pretty error messages with colors that are very useful for development as they usually pin point the issue.

However, when this data is serialized it contains a lot of unicode characters.

There are two use cases for disabling/better structuring the error logs:

1. In Production logs, one might want to read the error messages thrown by Photon.

2. In tools like Studio, it currently strips the ANSI characters (like [this](https://codesandbox.io/s/photon-pretty-errors-m4l77)) and displays the output as the error message.

// TODO: Stripping ANSI works well but it is still not parsable. A better Photon error structure with error code and message which serializes to something like `<ERROR_CODE>: <ERROR_MESSAGE>`

To solve these two use case, Photon can do the following:

1. Respect `NODE_ENV`

This would solve the production logs use case. When `NODE_ENV` is set to `development` or is unset, Photon can emit logs with colors. However, when `NODE_ENV` is set to `production` Photon can omit colors from the logs.

2. While Point 1 might already be enough for tools like Studio as well, Photon can additionally offer `prettyLogs` as a constructor argument to switch off the pretty error logging.
