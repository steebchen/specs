## Basic example

When starting out with a simple project like this:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma.yml
```

Executing `prisma migrate` will create the following folder structure and migrate the underlying database structure:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ migrate
‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20190322092247
‚îÇ¬†¬†     ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prisma.yml
```

So in addition to migrating the database, `prisma migrate` now also creates a new migration folder with the timestamp of the migration.

## Motivation

These are the main reasons we want to add migration files:

- Being able to run arbitrary data migration scripts
- Having SQL / other database native escape hatches to perform structural database changes which Prisma doesn't support yet

## Terminology

Assuming that the reader knows, what Prisma 1.x looks like, the following terms are new concepts which we introduce with this spec.

### Migration

When changing the datamodel of a Prisma project, we now have a new datamodel in the local filesystem, while the database and running Prisma instance don't know
yet about this change. The action of applying this diff between the old datamodel and the new one is called "performing a migration". In other words, you could
see the diff between two data models, that is going to be applied as a migration. While this is a concept that has been mostly hidden until now within Prisma
1.x, users of Prisma are going to be exposed to this concept. This allows more fine-grained control over how datamodel changes get applied in the database
(migrated).

### Migration Folder

Each migration is defined in its own folder. The convention of migration folders is the following: `TIMESTAMP-migration-name` Defining the migration-name is
optional.

### Migration Scripts

While Prisma solves the 95% use-case with the automatic migrations based on the user changing the datamodel, there are cases, in which this is not a sufficient
solution. One case could for example be, that I want to use a database primitive, which is not yet being supported by Prisma. In this case I would like to run a
database native script, e.g. a SQL script. I might also want to use a SQL script which will run after the migration was successful to insert data. If the
abstraction level of SQL is too low for me, having access to the Prisma Client would be very beneficial. Before introducing a `unique` constraint, I might for
example run a TypeScript script, which makes sure, that there are no duplicates in the database. So both migration scripts with the favorite language as
TypeScript, JavaScript or Go are possible, while we also support low-level database access in SQL and other database languages. There can be a `before` and
`after` script, being executed before the actual datamodel has been migrated or after it has been migrated.

### Migration Direction

In the case that a migration should be rolled back, you oftentimes want to revert its effects. When defining a migration script, this migration script must at
least have a "forward" also known as `up` direction, which is the action of applying the migration. The reversal of a migration is commonly known as the `down`
direction of the migration. While Prisma can automatically calculate the `down` for its built-in migrations, user-defined migration scripts need to define their
own `down`.

### Declarative migration

An example for a declarative migration is this: You start with datamodel `A` and change it to datamodel `B`, while not providing the actual steps needed to
achieve this change. The only thing you need to provide is the following:

`Datamodel A`

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String
}
```

`Datamodel B`

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String!
}
```

In this example we made the `name` field required. The actual steps needed to achieve the change will be _inferred_ by Prisma. Therefore we can also talk about
declarative migrations as **automatic migrations**.

### Imperative migration

In traditional migration systems as the one provided by [Active Record](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html), the actual change is
instead expressed in an imperative manner:

```ruby
class ChangeUserName < ActiveRecord::Migration[5.0]
  def change
    reversible do |dir|
      change_table :User do |t|
        t.string :name, null: false
      end
    end
  end
end
```

With imperative migrations, the user needs to both calculate the "diff" in his head and write the needed actions down, which will result in the new schema.

While in Prismas model the declarative datamodel is the source of truth for migrations, Active Record takes the imperative migrations as the source of truth for
migrations. Therefore one can call the imperative migrations also **manual migrations**.

### Datamodel Snapshots

As mentioned in [Declarative migration](#how-does-naming-of-migrations-work), the user adjusts the `datamodel.prisma` file, which results in a new migration
folder when running `prisma migrate`. In order for the migration engine to know which changes need to be applied, it needs a "copy" of the datamodel. As this
"copy" describes the datamodel in a specific point in time, we also refer to it as a "snapshot".

### Migration Engine

The migration engine is the heart of the whole migration system. It manages the connection to the database and performs the actual changes in the database
schema. It is written in Rust and will be remotely controlled from the Prisma CLI written in JavaScript.

### Migration History

When a migration is running or has been executed successfully, Prisma writes this information into a table or collection in the database. This table is also
known as the "Migration History". It includes all successful and failed migrations of the specific Prisma Project. The benefits of storing this migration
history are the following:

- Prisma can make sure, that the local migrations are in sync with the databases migrations
- Prisma can ensure, that migrations don't get run twice
- Prisma can give an overview in a GUI interface about the currently running migration and migrations that already have been running
- Prisma can rollback migrations when there has been an error

## Detailed design

As mentioned in the [basic example](#basic-example), a simple `prisma migrate` is needed to migrate the database and create a new migration.

These are the commands:

```bash
prisma migrate                                Creates a migration, clears the draft and migrates the database

       migrate plan                           Creates a migration without applying it
       migrate apply                          Applies all unapplied migrations
       migrate draft                          Pushes the new changes into a draft without creating a migration
       migrate rollback                       Rolls back migration(s)
```

Let's discuss a few questions.

### Naming of migration folders

When executing `prisma migrate` without providing any args, a migration with the name `yyyyMMddHHmmss` (e.g. `20190322092247`) will be created. Especially when
working in a team, it can be very useful to add a custom name to the migration. A name can be provided like this:

```bash
$ prisma migrate --name my-initial-migration
```

This will create the migration folder `migrate/20190322092247-my-initial-migration/` with the following content:

```bash
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 20190322092247-init
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ client.ts
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
```

This means that every migration will have its own generated Prisma Client in the chosen language (JS, TS or Go).

### Writing `before` or `after` migration scripts

There are a few use-cases when you want to run your own custom migration logic:

- Making sure that the data adheres to constraints that you want to introduce, like `unique` or `non null` constraints
- Adding specific database primitives like functions in Postgres, which are not yet supported by Prisma
- Initializing data after a migration has been executed. Both SQL or the Prisma Client could be useful here

Let's say that after Prisma has migrated the database to the datamodel defined in `migrate/20190322092247-my-initial-migration/`, you want to insert some seed
data. The way you can do this, is by either defining a shell script or an executable, either called `before.EXT`, while EXT is your favorite file extension as
`.sh` or `.js` or `after.EXT`. A file just called `before` or `after` is also valid.

Which file will be executed when is decided by a convention. When the Prisma CLI opens a migration folder, it will perform the following actions:

1. Check if there is only maximum one file with the `after` prefix and only maximum one file with the `before` prefix.
2. Check for the existence of a before file and try to execute it. The following filenames are valid:

| Filename    | Action         |
| ----------- | -------------- |
| before.sh   | sh before.sh   |
| before.bash | bash before.sh |
| before      | ./before       |
| before.js   | ./before.js    |
| before.ts   | ./before.ts    |

3. Migrate the datamodel
4. Check for the existence of an after file and try to execute it. The following filenames are valid:

| Filename   | Action        |
| ---------- | ------------- |
| after.sh   | sh after.sh   |
| after.bash | bash after.sh |
| after      | ./after       |
| after.js   | ./after.js    |
| after.ts   | ./after.ts    |

### Up & Down in migration scripts

In order to revert a migration in the case of a rollback, we need to distinguish between `up` (applying the migration) and `down` (reverting the migration). We
call this the **Migration Direction**. The direction of a migration is being passed in to a migration script using the env var `DIRECTION`. This can then e.g.
be accessed from a bash script with `echo $DIRECTION`.

### Transactional/rollback behavior of migration scripts

The main question is this: If a migration script fails (exists with a non-zero exit code) after the datamodel has been migrated, should the datamodel be rolled
back to the state before? The answer is yes. If you don't want the datamodel migration to be rolled back, make sure, that your migration script will not return
a non-zero exit code, by e.g. using `try` `catch` in Node.js or adding an `|| echo ""` behind the potentially failing command.

### Attaching migration information (`rename` & `migrationValue`)

The very nature of the declarative datamodel introduces ambiguities for transitions between two datamodels. One of these ambiguities is renaming a field.

If we have the following datamodel:

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID @id
  name: String
  address: String
}
```

And want to rename the `name` field, it's not clear if it should be renamed based on the `address` field or the `name` field:

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID @id
  name2: String
  address2: String
}
```

For the reader it's very clear what should happen, whereas it's not trivial to detect this programmatically as we can't rely on the order of fields in the
datamodel. The migration engine doesn't know, if it should rename `name` to `name2` or `name` to `address2` and vise versa. Maybe we even want to delete the
`name` field with all its data and create a new field called `name2`? Information for this transition between datamodels is needed.

One way to solve this is using the `@db` directive:

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID @id
  name: String @db(name: "name2")
  address: String @db(name: "address2")
}
```

This however may not be the desired outcome, because the underlying column still has the same name. The solution for this is, that the user manually edits the
`datamodel.prisma` file in the migration folder like this:

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID @id
  name: String @rename(oldName: "name2")
  address: String @rename(oldName: "address2")
}
```

There is another information, which the user may want to attach to a specific migration, which is the migration value. When already having 100 nodes in the
database and introducing a new field, you may want to define a value, which all of these nodes will have as a default, that is different from the default for
all new nodes that will be created. In order to address that, you can do the following change in the `datamodel.prisma` file in the migration folder.

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID @id
  firstName: String!
  lastName: String!
  fullName: String! @migrationValue(value: "Name unavailable")
}
```

If you want all existing nodes to have a specific precalculated value, you could now define a `post.ts` script like this:

```ts
#!/usr/bin/env ts-node

import client from "@prisma/client/201912121314";

async function main() {
  for await (const user of client.users()) {
    await client.updateUser({
      ...user,
      fullName: `${user.firstName} ${user.lastName}`
    });
  }
}
```

### Deleting old migrations

Let's say you use the migrations system for a couple of years and you accumulated over 1000 migrations. All your Prisma instances already include these changes,
so there is no point of storing migrations that are years old. If you decide that you don't need the first 500 migrations, you can simply delete these folders.
Note that you can't delete folders in between migrations, it always has to happen right from the beginning.

### Locking the database during migration to prevent data corruption

While performing a migration like turning an optional relational into a required one, it may be beneficial to apply a lock on the database to prevent data
corruption. We need to find out here if this should run on Prisma application level or in the individual database. It should be configurable to add this lock.
Probably it's something Prisma will provide in the future with the Prisma server but not with the Prisma binary.

### Migration execution order

Migrations are executed in a lexicographical order and with that in the order that they're stored in the filesystem.

### Solving merge conflicts

Let's say Alice and Bob start developing in their own branches based on the following datamodel:

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID! @id
  name: String
  address: String
}
```

And these migrations:

```bash
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migrate
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 2
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
```

`1` and `2` are just used for illustration, we're using timestamps in the real world.

Alice removes the `address` field and creates a new migration `4`.

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID @id
  name: String
}
```

```bash
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migrate
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 4
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
```

Her changes get deployed to production. Bob now pulls her changes and finds a merge conflict.

His `migrate` folder will look like this:

```bash
.
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ migrate
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 3
    ‚îÇ¬†¬† ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 4
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ datamodel.mdl
```

The main `datamodel.mdl` file will look like this:

```graphql
model User {
  id: ID @id
  name: String
<<<<<<< HEAD
  address: String?
=======
>>>>>>> master
  posts: [Post]
}

model Post {
  id: ID @id
  title: String
}
```

He now can clearly see, that in the `master` branch the field `posts` has been removed. Git is pointing him here to the merge conflict. Another important
conflict, where Git doesn't help us are the migration folders `3` and `4`.

The right way to solve this conflict is the following:

```
$ prisma migrate rollback # rollbacks 3
```

Now he renames `3` to `5`, so that his changes comes after `4`. He can confirm locally with a `prisma migrate` to his local machine that the change works and
push to production. The production system will now pick up the new `5` migration and apply it.

There is an infinite amount of conflict scenarios, so we're stopping here and won't go deeper into them. What matters is this: Prisma will be able to help
developers solving migration conflicts based on the _local migration history_ and the _remote migration history_.

### The draft mode

In the previous scenario it was quite easy to reason about the conflict resolution, as we just had to look into one migration from Alice and one from Bob. Let's
say that Alice had pushed 10 new migrations and the same for Bob, he also performed 10 migrations. This would be a very complicated situation to reason about.
In order to circumvent this issue, we strongly advice users to do two things:

1. Name your migrations. This will help your team to understand what happened in there
2. Group all your changes into as few migrations as possible. This way conflict resolution is way easier.

In order to make "grouping" or accumulating multiple schema changes into one migration, we introduce the `prisma migrate draft` command. With this command,
changes will be applied to the database without creating a new migration. As soon as you're happy with all the changes, you can execute `prisma migrate`, which
empties the draft and puts all accumulated changes into one new migration.

## Drawbacks

Providing a migration value or renaming requires SQL.

## Alternatives

All other systems that are known to us have an imperative approach of defining migrations. That means, their migrations include something like `createField`,
whereas with Prisma you just store the desired datamodel and Prisma infers the imperative actions automatically.

Popular other migration systems include:

### Go

- [Go Migrate](https://github.com/golang-migrate/migrate) Up & Down migrations
- [Goose](https://github.com/pressly/goose) Up & Down migrations
- [Go PG Migrations](https://github.com/robinjoseph08/go-pg-migrations) Mix between [go-pg/migrations](https://github.com/go-pg/migrations) and
  [Knex](https://knexjs.org/)
- [Gormigrate](https://github.com/go-gormigrate/gormigrate) Programmatic API with structs

### Python

- [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/2.1/topics/migrations/) Django style fixtures
- [Alembic](https://pypi.org/project/alembic/) Belongs to SQLAlchemy

### PHP

- [CakePHP - Phinx](https://github.com/cakephp/phinx) Belongs to CakePHP
- [Doctrine](https://www.doctrine-project.org/projects/doctrine-migrations/en/2.0/reference/managing-migrations.html#managing-migrations) Mix between PHP and
  SQL

### Java

- [Sequelize](http://docs.sequelizejs.com/manual/migrations.html)

### Ruby

- [Active Record](https://edgeguides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_migrations.html)

## Adoption strategy

This is a new paradigm of how to do migrations and should probably land in Prisma 2.

## How we teach this

Most of the migration flows are fairly easy to understand and are similar to what we already have. The difference is that now we're introducing files in the
filesystem and allow now use-cases. In addition with this migration system more complex merge conflicts can occur.

Both use-cases of hooks and conflicts need to be properly documented.
