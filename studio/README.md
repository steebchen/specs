# Tabbar
![Tabbar](https://i.imgur.com/I3NlV9s.png)

Tabs are one of the main workflow organization tools in Studio. They should feel lightweight to open, rearrange, switch between and close, all while having confidence that no data or state is accidentally dropped or removed.

A tab can contain a variety of content, from databrowser tables to dashboards and settings views.

## Opening a new tab
![Quick open modal](https://i.imgur.com/vefE25X.png)

Since tabs can represent a variety of views it makes it difficult to have a standard "empty state".

So instead of a blank tab, when a user clicks the "plus" icon (or hits `⌘ + T`) we would show a "quick open modal" that lets user search and open (or navigate to) any model, saved query, settings or other page.

When a "non-dirty" version of selected link is already open in an existing tab, user will be redirected into that one instead of opening a new one.

## Tab states
There are two potential UX problems with tabs:
- accidentally closing tabs that contain unsaved queries, filters or other changes
- having a new tab open on each link click, potentially overflowing the tabbar with unused tabs

In order to alleviate those problems, we need track (and indicate) tab state and change it's behaviour accordingly.

Tab can have three states: [preview](#preview-tab), [sticky](#sticky-tab) and [dirty](#dirty-tab).

### Preview tab
![Preview tab](https://i.imgur.com/PEySXvc.png)

Any newly opened tab is in a _preview_ state. This is indicated by italic name in the tab.

While in _preview_ mode, the content of a tab is replaced when a user clicks on another link in the sidebar, or on a relation in a databrowser.

When focusing into another tab, the _preview_ tab stays in the tabbar. When a user then clicks on anything that usually would open in a new tab, the click target would be opened in the previously created _preview_ tab instead.

No confirmation asked when closing the _preview_ tab.

### Sticky tab
![Sticky tab](https://i.imgur.com/QNJ1T07.png)

User can open a sidebar link as an _sticky_ tab instead of _preview_ by double-clicking on the link. User can also double-click on the tab itself to turn it from _preview_ to _sticky_.

While in an _sticky_ tab and clicking on a sidebar link, the click target should open in a new _preview_ tab and focus into it.

No confirmation asked when closing the _sticky_ tab.

### Dirty tab
![Dirty tab](https://i.imgur.com/wCDSXcz.png)

A tab turns "dirty" as soon as there is some potential state or data that could be lost when closing the tab.

**Examples include..**
- A databrowser tab, where user has changed either...
  * filters
  * field selection
  * sorting
  * (pagination?)
- A databrowser tab, where user has switched to Photon query mode and customized the query
- A databrowser tab, where user has changed data, but not commited it to database
- A settings page where user has not saved their chages

While in an _dirty_ tab and clicking on a sidebar link, the click target should open in a new _preview_ tab and focus into it.

When closing the tab, user will be asked either to discard or save the changes.

# Keyboard navigation
![Keyboard nav](https://i.imgur.com/6Q6N47A.png)

The goal is to support as extensive usage of Studio through keyboard as possible. The keyboard navigation and shortcuts should feel natural to use and adjust themselves depending on the scope in focus.

- While many of the keyboard shortcuts apply globally, navigating with keyboard benefits from having areas or "layers" of the app separated into different scopes.

- As a common navigation pattern, hitting `tab` key should generally move focus to the next element and `shift + tab` to the previous element.

- Depending on the scope, that element might for example be a tab, databrowser, result row or a result row cell.

- Generally, unless scope as has assigned a different behavior, the arrow keys should also move the focus inside the scope. Both horizontally and vertically, when applicable.

- Entering a scope happens with `enter` and exiting with `shift + enter` or `esc` key.
