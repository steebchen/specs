Prisma obviously uses GitHub for hosting our git repositories. This document specifies which repositories we consider part of our main offering, and how we decide when to create an additional repository.

## Repository Creation Guidelines

- In theory everything could live in one big, happy repo ðŸŽ…
- Split if clearly defined separate tool (e.g. `photonjs`, `lift`)
- Split if issues should be collected in separate location (e.g. `prisma-engine`)
- Split if separation necessary for technical reasons (CI, commits)  (e.g. `prisma-engine`)
- Split if usage outside of Prisma could be useful (e.g. `prisma-query`)
- That being said, the current split and guidelines are somewhat arbitary and might change in the future
